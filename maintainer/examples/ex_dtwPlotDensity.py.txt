A study of the "Itakura" parallelogram

A widely held misconception is that the "Itakura parallelogram" (as
described in the original article) is a global constraint.  Instead,
it arises from local slope restrictions. Anyway, an "itakuraWindow",
is provided in this package. A comparison between the two follows.

The local constraint: three sides of the parallelogram are seen

>>> (query, reference) = dtw_test_data.sin_cos()
>>> ita = dtw(query, reference, keep_internals=True, step_pattern=typeIIIc)

>>> #TODO dtwPlotDensity(ita)


Symmetric step with global parallelogram-shaped constraint. Note how
long (>2 steps) horizontal stretches are allowed within the window.

>>> ita = dtw(query, reference, keep_internals=True, window_type=itakuraWindow)

>>> #TODO dtwPlotDensity(ita)
